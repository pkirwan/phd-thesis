    \begin{itemize}
        \item The late HIV diagnosis reclassification methodology described in Chapter~\ref{cha:hivbackcalc} and Appendix~\ref{appx:hivbackcalc} was developed in collaboration with epidemiologists at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA)\@. I helped to define the research question, extracted the data and did the analysis, defined the final reclassification methodology, and wrote the manuscript~\parencite{Kirwan2022-za}.
        \item The hospitalised severity analyses described in Chapter~\ref{cha:hospitalseverity} were completed in collaboration with epidemiologists and statisticians at UKHSA and the MRC Biostatistics Unit\@. I contributed to the design of the analysis and the statistical models, cleaned the data and ran the statistical analysis, and wrote the two manuscripts~\parencite{Kirwan2022-ka, Kirwan2021-sw}.
        \item The Cox proportional hazards analyses described in Chapter~\ref{cha:siren} and Appendix~\ref{appx:siren} was a collaboration with epidemiologists and statisticians at UKHSA\@. I gave significant input into the research:\ preparing the dataset, implementing the models in R, and generating the estimates, and was a co-author on the two manuscripts~\parencite{Hall2022-ep, Hall2024-ai}.
        \item The multi-state model analysis described in Chapter~\ref{cha:siren} was undertaken in collaboration with epidemiologists and statisticians at UKHSA and the MRC Biostatistics Unit. I designed the multi-state models, cleaned the data and ran the statistical analysis, and wrote the manuscript~\parencite{Kirwan2024-hj}.
