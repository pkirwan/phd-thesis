\subsection{Goodness of fit}\label{appendix:sari-gof}

For the SARI-Watch data, goodness of fit of the parametric mixture models was assessed by comparing non-parametric Aalen-Johansen cumulative incidence curves to estimates derived from the parametric model. A log-normal distribution was used for the hospital to ICU transition, and generalized gamma distributions used for other transitions. Figures~\ref{fig:sari-gof-hosp} and~\ref{fig:sari-gof-icu} show goodness of fit for each of the sub-models, by month of admission (panel A) and month of admission and sex (panel B).

\subsection{Outcomes following ICU admission}\label{appendix:sari-icu}

The estimated probability of death among patients admitted to critical care by month of admission, sex, age group, and number of comorbidities is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sari-icu-prob}, panels A--D. The probability of death following ICU admission fell from \var{sari_icu_death_mar} in March 2020 to \var{sari_icu_death_jun} in June-August 2020, increased to \var{sari_icu_death_oct} in October and plateaued at around \var{sari_icu_death_novdec} between November and December 2021. The probability of death following ICU admission was estimated to be greater among older patients compared to younger patients, although confidence intervals are wide for these smaller sub-groups.

Error bands are 95\% CIs to represent uncertainty in the estimated probability.}\label{fig:sari-icu-prob}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:sari-med-time-icu}, panels A--D, shows lengths of stay in ICU by month of admission, sex, age group, and number of comorbidities. Compared to non-critical care patients, those admitted to critical care spent longer in hospital. Median length of stay in ICU prior to discharge initially reduced from \var{sari_los_icu_disc_mar} in March 2020 to \var{sari_los_icu_disc_jun} in June-August 2020, then increased to \var{sari_los_icu_disc_dec} in December 2020. Median length of stay in ICU prior to death showed less variability over time, ranging between \var{sari_los_icu_death} days.

\subsection{Weighted median with weighted ties}\label{sec:weighted-median}

For the $n$ elements in $\bm{x} = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ with positive weights $\bm{w} = (w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n)$ and $S = \sum_n w_n$, the weighted median is the element $x_k$ where~\parencite{Cormen2022-pi}:
%
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{i<k} w_i & \leq \frac{S}{2} \\
    \sum_{i>k} w_i & \leq \frac{S}{2}
\end{align*}

When ties occur between two values $x_k$ which satisfy the weighted median criteria, the median is a weighted average of the two values, weighted by the sum of weights for all values $x_i \leq x_k$, and $x_i \geq x_k$, respectively.

\subsection{Epidemic phase bias}\label{appendix:epi-phase-bias}

Figure~\ref{fig:fg-shift} shows the results of sensitivity analyses where the date of symptom onset was shifted later in time by $c = 0,1,2,3,4$ days for those who died, but not for those who were discharged. This model included stratification on age group, region of residence, and vaccination status, and regression adjustment on month of hospital admission, sex, ethnicity, IMD quintile, hospital load, and CCI\@.
